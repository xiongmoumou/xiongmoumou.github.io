<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year Master's Student at the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, under the supervision of Prof. Ming Gao and [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) in the X101 lab. I am currently a research intern at Shanghai AI LAB, supervised by [Dr. Zhiyong Wu](https://lividwo.github.io/zywu.github.io/).

My research interests include:
- **Large Language Models:** applications in scientific research, knowledge editing;
- **AI Agent:** OS Agent, GUI Agent, GUI foundation model.
<!-- My research interests include data mining, especially graph mining. The research work I have been involved in encompasses heterogeneous graph mining and weakly supervised learning on graphs. -->
<!-- Currently I am exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). -->
