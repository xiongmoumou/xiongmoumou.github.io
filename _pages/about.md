<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. Student at the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) in the PLANING lab.

My research interests include:
- **Data mining:** graph neural networks, heterogeneous graph mining;
- **Large Language Models:** scientific research, knowledge editing;
- **Combination of GNNs and LLMs:** graph foundation models, graph prompt learning.
<!-- My research interests include data mining, especially graph mining. The research work I have been involved in encompasses heterogeneous graph mining and weakly supervised learning on graphs. -->
<!-- Currently I am exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). -->
